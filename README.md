### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Zul. I'm active as student in Fullstack JS Bootcamp now, learning Next.js in this week.
I'm Open for hire. My competencies mostly in front-end JavaScript. Currently learning more for back-end and React.

I love to work in the open, see my projects!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and web development ecosystem in general
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting OSS, related to JavaScript. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning all this web stack! So much! soo much! Also how to get a job.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Basic JavaScript, SASS, Eleventy, Tailwind CSS/
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: `ivan dot zulfikar` + `gmail`. I don't use social media much.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not a very fun guy.
